				At the core of the new analytics movement is a stat called CORSI.</p>
			<p class="crosbyspeech" id="crosby2"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow_sticker.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
				CORSI is a new way to track shots. In the past we’ve just been looking at shots on goal, CORSI is tracking total shot attempts. </p>
			<p class="crosbyspeech" id="crosby3"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow_sticker.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
				CORSI correlates with winning more than any other stat. 75% of teams in the top 10 CORSI for the past 10 years have made the playoffs.

			</p>
			<p class="crosbyspeech" id="crosby10"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow_sticker.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
				The only differnce is Fenwick doesn't count blocked shots, because it considers blocked shots to be a skill.

			<p class="crosbyspeech" id="crosby11"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow_sticker.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
				Important to note is Sample size. Player’s performance varies greatly game to game, but over the course of a season you will see the repeatability of CORSI come into play.

				You may be wondering, why not just take a ton of shots on net as much as possible. Thats not as easy as it sounds with today’s highly structured defensive systems.

		<div id="introtext1"><p id=headline>Why do people care about hockey analytics?</p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of analytics is to figure out what events cause an outcome to happen what the best way is to make that outcome happens again. Finding <a class="define" id="defCorrelation">correlations</a> between these events is extremely important. 
 <a><img class="introarrow" src="../images/arrow.png"></img></a>
		</div> 

		<a class="correlation">
		<img src="../images/defBox-sticker.png" id="CorrCanvas"></img>
				<img src="../images/blinking-stick.gif" id="chartButton"></img>

				<p id="CorrGraph1">Correlation is the relationship between two concepts. In this case, its a team's CORSI% (don't worry about what CORSI is right now) and their chances of winning. As you can see, the <span style="color:red;">Red team</span> has a much higher CORSI for%, thus a higher winning %. Watch what happens if we lower their CORSI for% to just over 50%.</p>
<p id="CorrGraph2">Not only does <span style="color:red;">The Red Team</span> move close to the 50% for winning chances, <span style="color:blue;">the Blue Team</span> does as well. There is a very close relationship between these two stats. Because the stats are from two opposing teams, they will always being moving with each other. This is as extreme as the two stats can go. </p>
<p id="CorrGraph3">You can see that the two teams,<span style="color:red;"> Red </span>and <span style="color:blue;"> blue</span>, have an extremely high correlation. The must add up to 100%, so when one goes up, the other must come down.  </p>

</div>		 <div class ="medium-2 columns">
</div></div>
</a>
	<div id="introtext2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is a high correlation between scoring more goals than your opponent and winning. Even if that seems obvious, its an important relationship to make, because you can then start to look at bigger questions, like “what allows my team to score goals?”  and “how can I stop the other team from scoring goals?”.

</div>

	<div id="introtext3">The concept of <a class="define" id="defRepeat"> repeatability </a> is incredibly important for any type of analytics. Goals themelves are not a great example of a repeatable metric, because they rely on many factors like shot location, quality of shot, defender’s position, goalie’s position, goalie’s strengths and weaknesses.
<a><img class="introbackarrow" src="../images/backarrow.png"></img></a>

	</div>
	<a class="repeatability">
	<img src="../images/defBox-sticker.png" id="RepCanvas"></img>
		<p id="RepGraph1">Repeatability is a measure of the effectiveness of a statistic. For a statistic (or a study) to be considered good, it should be able to be replicated with extremely similar results. For example, the sun setting in the west is a repeatable event, its all but guaranteed to happen every day. Thus, it’d have a repeatability of 1 (the highest it can be, from a 0-1 scale).</p>
		<p id="RepGraph2">
			In the example above, we are measuring a coin flipping 2,000 times and seeing how many times it lands on heads, and how many times it lands on tails. Because the ratio of<span style="color:#E8C07F;"> heads</span> to <span style="color:#58DAFF;">tails</span> will vary, this won’t have a repeatability of 1, but 95% of the time it will end up between 900-1100 heads, which gives it a repeatability of .9.</p>
		<p id="RepGraph3">You can end up with extreme outliers, like 750 <span style="color:#E8C07F;"> heads</span> and 1250 <span style="color:#58DAFF;">tails</span>, are less than 1 in 5,000. So the point of measuring repeatability isn't about if an event can happen, but how likely it is to happen.</p>

	<div id="introtext4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However a metric like shot attempts (better known as CORSI, but we will be getting more into that in Shot Metrics and Rate Stats) is much more repeatable because it relies on less separate factors, although those factors still do exist).

	<div id="introtext5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports analytics have been a rapidly growing field for decades, especially now in the public sphere. More people having more access to open data has led to some tremendous innovations in sports analytics, some of which have begun to trickle its way into professional sports leagues.  
<a><img class="introbackarrow" src="../images/backarrow.png"></img></a>
	<a><img class="introarrow" src="../images/arrow.png"></img></a>
</div>

	<div id="introtext6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves bucking classic notions, like the importance of a player’s size, that fights revitalize a team, and +/- is the best metric to understand how a player performs. This creates a rift between modern analytic workers and classic hockey heads. 
<a><img class="introbackarrow" src="../images/backarrow.png"></img></a>
	<a><img class="introarrow" src="../images/arrow.png"></img></a>
</div>

	<div id="introtext7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It transforms a game of energy and excitement to a game of numbers and probabilities, which can understandably suck the fun out for some people. Analytics don’t have to be fun, but they are an important managerial (or armchair GM) tool. 
<a><img class="introbackarrow" src="../images/backarrow.png"></img></a>
	<a><img class="introarrow" src="../images/arrow.png"></img></a>

</div>
	<div id="introtext8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will always be complications of numbers due to player use, coach strategies and who they are playing with, but with enough work analytics can erase those concerns. But if you’d like to understand player evaluation without watching games better, continue on this journey with me.

			<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy1"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
There’s been a long standing battle in player evaluation between the “eye test” and metric based analytics.
			<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy2"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
				The eye test is what it sounds like, how good a player appears to be from just watching him. The value of a person’s eye test very much depends on how knowledgeable and trustworthy a person’s hockey IQ is. </p>
			<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy3"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Metric based analytics track measurable things like what happens on the ice, how many shots for a player is on ice for, how often a player has the puck on his stick and, more recently, how a player exits the defensive zones and enters offensive zones.</p>
			<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy4"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Critics of the eye test point out that biases, like being the fan of a team or lucky scoring streaks, can heavily influence a person’s eye test. The eye test also tends to miss what happens away from the play, like positioning that might not be captured by tv cameras.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy5"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Critics of analytics often blame analysts for putting too much into numbers, not needing to watch games to evaluate and through talk of unquantifiables, like leadership, strength and grit.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy6"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Whats the most effective way of evaluating players? Like most things, it lies somewhere in the middle of everything else. Analytics are extremely helpful for cancelling out biases and evaluating smaller things that may not be initially noted on viewing.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy7"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Watching a player play is incredibly important to understanding their style. You can infer parts of their game from which metrics they succeed in, but you cannot know how smooth a skater is from their CORSI%.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy8"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
This is a video of <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/users/Jack_Han/blog" target='_blank'>Jack Han</a> breaking down a player’s play through the “eye-test”. This video is less focused on player evaluation than team strategy, but the breaking down of what goes on on-ice is very similar.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy9"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
<a href="http://ownthepuck.blogspot.com/" target='_blank'>Dom Galamini</a> has done a fantastic job of combining the two, creating a metric chart called hero charts. These balance things like quality of teammates and competition, as well as the player’s role.</p>
<p class="bergyspeech" id="bergy10"><img src="../images/blinking-arrow.gif" id="speechButton"></img>
Even these charts can be taken out of context, and used inappropriately, but when it comes to snapshot player evaluation, the HERO charts, are about as good as it gets in this point in time.</p>
